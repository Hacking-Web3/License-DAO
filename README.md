# üìù LicenseDAO | DAOHacks hackathon 2022

### Primer üß†

License DAO is a collectivelly managed and standardised repository of IP licenses residing on the IPFS. 

Everything we publish on web pages is licensed. One way or another. Copyright, GNU License, CC0 license, CC BY license, ToS of a platform or a specific tailored license. 

While there‚Äôs no consensus around the NFT licenses yet and developers often link CC0 back to the Creative Commons website, we propose the licenses to be stored on the IPFS and managed by the LicenseDAO to create legal certainty for the Web3 community. 

### Technical details ‚öôÔ∏è

For this project we wanted to go with a fully decentralized approach, for this reason we chose to host the website on the IPFS, manage events with graphs on GraphiQL, and use web3 storage and ceramic to host the licenses and cover letters, thus allowing our infrastructure to be fully on chain with no centralised function.

 - Website stored on IPFS
 - Events managed with GraphiQL
 - Cover letters sent to IPFS storage
 - Licenses hosted on Ceramic infrastructures

### Problems we solve üõ†Ô∏è
 
 - LicenseDAO resolves the legal uncertainties around the storage of the IP rights content creators want to attach to their digital assets. 
 - It offers a broader specter of licenses collectivelly composed, recognised as valid and used by the Web3 community without the need to rely on one server, entity or jurisdiction at the time.
 - By design, the IPFS stored licenses protect their creations in a much more resilient and efficient manner than regular licensing frameworks. In addition, this protocol layer solution allows for automated, on-chain execution of reserved or waived rights. 
 - Content creators can now adhere to a simplified and standardised framework to build complex revenue-split relationships and will no longer have to rely on platforms alone to provide such solutions.

## Quick Start üèÅ

   bash
   ```yarn install```
   
üí° if yarn is not already installed, check [the yarn website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

2. run the tests
bash
# Run all the tests üß™
yarn test

The test will deploy automatically and you should see the transactions happening

## More information!

- run all test with yarn test


## Mockups Time !! üì≤

#### 4. Voting !

After a license has been submitted for review, you can consult it and vote for or against it, the vote system will work with a minimum quorum, and requires at least 51% of votants to be in favor of it to adopt the new license.

This sums up the basis of the website.
